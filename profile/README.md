# Built-On-Openfin

This repository is maintained by OpenFin and is a collection of examples and applications that demonstrate the capabilities of the OpenFin platform. It is a companion repository to the primary [OpenFin Organization](https://github.com/openfin)

The examples can be used by developers who are interested in building applications with OpenFin, and who want to see how different features and functionalities can be implemented.

Developers can clone or download the repositories to get started with building their own applications, or they can use the code as a reference for their own projects.

> **Although every effort has been taken to make sure the code in the repositories functions as intended, it should not be treated as production ready code.**
